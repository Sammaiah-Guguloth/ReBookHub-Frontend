ReBook Hub is a fully functional book marketplace platform that enables users to buy, sell,
and manage second-hand books with ease. The platform provides features such as book
listing, advanced search and filtering , order management and secure payment handling.
It is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS,
and leverages additional tools and libraries for a modern, performant experience.

The frontend of ReBook Hub is built using ReactJS, enabling dynamic and responsive user
interfaces. Styling is handled using Tailwind CSS, which allows for a clean utility-based
approach and includes built-in classes for smooth transitions and animations without relying
heavily on external libraries. Framer Motion is used sparingly for enhanced animation effects
on key UI components. The interface supports both dark and light modes, delivering a
visually pleasing and accessible experience across devices. Communication with the backend
is done via RESTful APIs.
